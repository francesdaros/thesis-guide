# Thesis Writing Guide and Thesis Template 

This repository contains a concise guide on how to write a scientific thesis, with a focus on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Most of the material follows the guidelines used at the Università degli Studi di Udine, but it may be helpful for students at many other institutions.

The guide is aimed at Bachelor’s and Master’s students preparing their thesis.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `docs/guide.html` :
A standalone HTML version of the thesis-writing guide.
You can open it directly in any web browser.

- `template/` :
A folder containing the LaTeX thesis template I have used for my own Ph.D. Tehsis.
This can be used as a starting point for structuring your own thesis (LaTeX, depending on what you include). Back in time, it was inspired by the [template](https://github.com/baronefr/unipd-thesis-modern?tab=readme-ov-file) by F. Barone. 

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

- Read the [Guide](https://francesdaros.github.io/thesis-guide/guide.html) for practical advice on writing each chapter of a thesis, managing bibliography, designing figures and tables, and maintaining good academic writing standards.

- Use the template in `template/` as a reference structure for your thesis.

Feel free to adapt the material to fit the requirements of your supervisor, program, or institution.
